Solution = Software Engineering:
- Emphasis on systematic development
- Concentration on finding out exact software requirements
- Formal / Semi-formal specification of the requirements of a system
- Building Prototypes
- Greater emphasis on creating error-free code
- Computer Assistance:
	Modelling activity
	Problem solving activity
	Knowledge acquisition activity

Software Engineering Definition:

Standish Group Chaos report analyses effect of diffrent methodologies

-> Agile is useful for projects of all size in comparison to Waterfall

-> Yet most succesful factors:
	Executive Sponsorship
	Emotional Maturity
	User Involvement
	Optimization
	Skilled Resouces
	Standard Architecture
	Agile Process
	Modest Execution
	Project Management Expertise
	Clear Business Objectives

Though the Standish Report hyped Agile, two sides to every story.

- Agile! The Good, The Hype, The Ugly (2014) = Bertrand Meyer

" To summarize, these results are inconsistent, not confirmed by other studies, and based on proprietary data that independent researchers are not able to see "

" The industry ignores such absolutism; every group devises its own selection, picking some practices and rejecting others "
