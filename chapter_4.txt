Scrum:
	An agile process. Highest business value -> Shortest Time
	Allows rapid inspection of working software (Every 2 weeks / month)
	Business sets the priorites - Teams self organise to determine best way to deliver high priority features
	Every two weeks / month = anyone can see real working softwareand decide to release as is, or enhance in next sprint

Product Backlog -> Sprint backlog -> 2/4 week sprint with daily meetings -> Potentially shippable product increment

Constant sprint duration = Better Rhythm
	Product -> Designed, coded and tested during sprint

Scrum teams do a little of everything all the time -> Rather than doing all of one thing at a time

CHANGES KEPT OUT OF SPRINT:

Roles:
	-> Product Owner
	-> Scrum Master
	-> Team

Ceremonies:
	-> Sprint planning
	-> Sprint review
	-> Sprint retrospective
	-> Daily scrum meeting

Artefacts:
	-> Product backlog
	-> Sprint backlog
	-> Burndown charts

Product Owner:

	Define features of the product, decide on release date / content

	Be responsible for profitability of project
		-> Determines potential ROI (Return on investment) For each user story

	Priortise features according to market value

	Adjust features / priortiy every sprint

	Accept or reject work results

	Decide if increment is released 

The Scrum Master:

	Represents management to the project
	
	Responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices

	Removes impediments to progress

	Ensure the team is fully functional / productive

	Enable close cooperation across all roles / functions
	
	Shield the team from external interferences

The Scrum Team:
	Opinions differ: may vary from 3-9 people (SM / PO only included if they are actively developing)

	Cross functional: Programmers / Testers / UI designers -> All skills needed

	Members should be full-time (Some exceptions made where skills are in short supply)
	
	Teams self-organising = Decide what work to do
	
	Membership should change only between sprints according to next sprint goal

***************************************************************************************************************

Sprint Planning:
	Time boxed to max 8 hours for one month sprint, less for shorter sprints
	Teams pick highest priority tasks from backlog and commit to completing
	
	Sprint backlog is created:
		Tasks identified and each is estimated 1-7 hours
		Done collaboratively
		User Stories used

****************************************************************************************************************

Daily Scrum:
	Daily 15 minute, stand up:
		Quick = Avoids unneccasry meetings,
			what did you do yesterday, what to do today, what do you need help with

		Commitment in front of peers = Very social

Scrum Master is responsible for moving the reporting along quickly
One person talks at a time, Everyone listens, No side conversations, No Gossip

Common Daily Meetings Problem:
	Implicit Impediments:	People are not truly honest about the severity of problems
	Side Discussion
	People ramble and waste time
	Sidetracked meeting: Meeting sometimes happen immeditaly afterwards
	Late Arrivals

*********************************************************************************************************************

The Sprint Review:
	Scrum Team presents what it accomplished during sprint:
		Typically there's a demo of new feature
	
	Informal 2 hour prep time
	4 hour meeting for one month sprint Scrum Team / Stakeholders / Product Owner

Scrum Team discusses what went well, problems they ran into. Demonstrates work.
Owner provides feedback, and change requests

Owner discusses product backlog and may project likely completion dates

Entire group collaborates on what to do next - Valuable insight into next Sprint Planning

********************************************************************************************************************

Sprint Retrospective: -> Look at what is and is not working

Occurs after every Sprint Review and before Sprint planning

3-hour meeting for one month sprints

Whole team participates

Inspect how sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process and tools

Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements

Create a plan for making improvements to the way the scrum team does its work:
	
	Product Quality Improves
	Processes improve

********************************************************************************************************************

Product Backlog:
	List of all requirements / desireed work that is currently known
	Ideally expressed such that each item has value to the users or customers of the product -> User Stories
	Priortised by the product owner
	Reprioritised at the start of each sprint

Sprint Goal -> Short statement of what work will be focused on during the sprint

*****************************************************************************************************************

Managing Sprint Backlog:

Never assigned, people sign up,
Every day update the estimated work reminaing
Only a small number of ACTIVE tasks and stories
