Designing a UI:

Meet and Exceed customer expecatations.

If System is similar to other well established systems:
	Provide features as:
				Convenient
				Usable
				Entertaining
				Refined
					As customers expect

Keep user-system interactions as simple as possible

When features need to be explaine:
	Provide the right levels of context-specific help

Make sure customers will want to return, so avoid:
	Colour schemes that are hard on the eyes / fonts that can't be read
	Sound effects the user can't control
	Unnecessarily complex navigation / control paths
	
MAKE most important features easiest to access and use

The customer wants to return so:

Provide a good intro for begineers - immediate usability

Adapt to customers usage patterns
	Remember where files are, where last session ended

Allow customers to customise:
	Adjust / Adapt features - so that the system enables them to do what they want to do,
		System becomes their own

Cover the basics well

Then you can innovate

Providing features that your customer wants that no-one else is offering, and you know how to deliever is #1
