Software Assurance: Intended to deal with:
	Malice
	Error
	Mischance

-> Prevent certain things from happening: Unathorised foregin government can read a citizens files

Traditional Software Engineering -> Aims to ensure certain things DO happen.

Security Engineering covers Cryptography, Security.
	Most systems fail because desginers protect the wrong things / right things in wrong way


Security Engineering involves combo of:
	User Authentication
	Transaction Integrity
	Accountability
	Fault Tolerance
	Message Secrecy
	Covertness -> Keep out of sight

UKs first national cyber security program established and funded coalesce ad hoc activity across 5 facets of trustworthy software:

Trustworthiness = Safety, Reliability, Availability, Resilience, Security

Cybok project aims to bring cyber security into line with the more established sciences by distilling knowledge from major international recognised experts to form a security Body of knowledge

Data Information Security Triad:
	Confidentially / Integrity / Avaliability

Confidential:
	Protection against unathorised access, passwords, health data transmitted over open channels
	Confidenttiality: Disclousre of sensitive info

Integrity:
	State - a measure of the validity and fidelity of a data object:
		Ensuring it's correct / corresponds to the original
	Function - Maintaining information exactly as it was inputted, ensuring that it can be audited to affirm its reliability
		Preventing unintentional change / corruption during transport
	Process - Verifying data has remained unaltered

Availabilty:
	Providing user access at the approiate time (Internet) / Correct location, communication services
	Medical emergency services, sales channels, online platforms
